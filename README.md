# Repository for interview questions
# General best practices: 
## A great question has a solution that is reachable by any qualified candidate, and a more nuances / optimal / interesting answer that a great candidate will get
## If a single piece of insight makes a question drastically easier, it is probably too much of a trick question or relies on a particular paradigm
## Don't require specific knowledge, especially that which people may have forgotten. Expect a good candidate to derive an algorithm, not know it offhand
## No diagrams over the phone! 
## If you're looking for style, tests, edge cases, etc, say so!
